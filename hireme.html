      <h2>What I&#8217;m good at</h2>

      <h3>Ruby &amp; Rails Application Performance</h3>

        <p>As your application and team grows there will often be times when you hit a wall. Your application isn&#8217;t performing fast enough and your customers are noticing. You want to build big new feature but there are too many technical challenges preventing it. You built a great beta but now as you try to move to a real v1, it&#8217;s breaking at the seams.</p>

        <p>I&#8217;ve been working with Ruby and Rails for over 8 years now on both small and massive applications. Performance matters: not only can it improve your customers experience, but it can improve your bottom line by requiring less hardware or resources as you grow.</p>

        <p>I&#8217;ve given a number of well regarded talks at Ruby conferences about performance and scaling, including at RubyConf 2014.</p>


        <p>I can help you and your team find and fix the lowest hanging fruit or figure out that final challenge thats preventing you from moving to the next level.</p>

      <h3>Continuous Deployment &amp; Integration</h3>

        <p>One thing that separates fast moving companies from the rest is their ability to deliver new features and fixes to their customers. Creating and developing the internal tooling necessary to do this is crucial to the long term success of your team. Having fully automated deploys, tests, and other critical tests means that you can get code out immediately and without fear. It means having developers focus on the work thats important, not the menial tasks surrounding deploying.</p>

        <p>I gave a talk at DevOpsDays NYC with some philosophy and examples around this type of automation:</p>

        <p>I can work with you and your team to design and implement these tools so that you can spend more time working on your product (or doing whatever you would rather be doing).</p>

      <h3>Infrastructure Scaling, Metrics, and Automation</h3>

        <p>Infrastructure is more than servers and the code your primary application. Its all the systems, programs, and pieces that connect together to form and support your product. This can be very small or very large, but chances are, if your company is growing, your infrastructure is growing as well. Whether you have a full time ops team or offload that somewhere else, you still need the insight and tools to know whats going on in your system at all times. This starts with setting up and digesting some basic metrics to building full scale automation platforms and applications to make the job of growth a much less painful process.</p>

        <p>I gave a talk at the first ever Monitorama about how we can think about infrastructure scaling and monitoring going forward.</p>

        <h2>How we can work together</h2>

      <article>
        <h3>On-site training and workshops</h3>

        <p>I&#8217;ll come to you and your office for either one-on-one training or group workshops with a specific goal. This can range from single or multiple full day sessions or just a couple focused hours to get your or your team to the next level.</p>

        <h3>Project based consulting</h3>

        <p>If you have a specific need or project in mind I&#8217;m happy to help work within your team or on my own to achieve your goal. This can be short term small projects or full applications or products.</p>

        <h3>Architecture and Planning Advisor</h3>

        <p>I&#8217;m also happy to work with you as a long term technical advisor to your engineering or product team. Think of this as having a very experienced part-time CTO or Technical Co-founder who can help guide your big technical decision making.</p>
